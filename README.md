# Interior-angle-finder

by KiwiHuman


This scrypt/program is a project I developed for fun after descovering a formula n(180-360/n) that calculates the sum of the internal angles in a polygon 
I do not expect this to be usefull for anything as regular shapes with absurd numbers of sides tend to look verry much like circles
and shapes with 100's of thousands of sides aren't often seen. However I thought this would be intersting to automate and got carried away with making a
full-blown scrypt to calculate and log the internal angles in shapes. I hope the scrypt could be intresting or usefull to someone but this was mainly an 
oppotunity to practice using python as I had not programmed in a while as well as learning to read and write files in python 

In the future I would like to make some improvements such as custom filenames and save locations as well as support for csv formats and maby more     ''')
